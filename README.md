Source code for the demonstration of using [Tabletop](https://github.com/times/angular-tabletop), Google Sheets and AngularJS to extend NationBuilder signups.

See the full blog post here.

## Demo file
The file `theme/demo.html` has been manually created to demo the Angular code. It's a compilation of all the includes in the layout.html and the Liquid code is replaced with the static HTML you might expect it to render.

This way, you can run and even step through the Javascript code by launching a simple webserver on your localhost and browsing to `theme/demo.html`

## Repository Layout

* `theme` the files you would need to put in your theme
* `site` the custom templates for individual pages on your site
